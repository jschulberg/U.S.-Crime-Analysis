# Linear Regression ----------------------------------------------------
######################################################################## 
# In the first section, we'll use a simple linear regression model to
# predict on our crime data.
# Start by scaling the data so it's standardardized. Avoid column 2 because 
# it's an indicator (factor) for southern states
data_scaled <- as_tibble(scale(data_crime[, c(1, 3:16)]))

# bring column 2 back in and reorder our columns
data_scaled <- data_scaled %>%

# Before we build our first Linear Regression model, let's set our seed to ensure randomness
set.seed(123)

# Let's also turn off scientific notation, because it'll make our results messy to read

### Build our first model using every variable as an output. Print the results

# The first two items we should look at are the R-squared value (80.3%) and the Adjusted R-squared value (71.8%)
# The next item we should look at is the overal p-value, which is p-value: 0.0000003539. This means that our crime data
# can be explained by the amalgam of predictor variables we provided



# What do our coefficients look like?
model_lm1$coefficients
# As an example of what this means, if M (percentage of males aged 14-24 in total state population) increases by 1,
# we would expect crime to increase by 87.83 crimes per 100,000 population.

# But which of the variables mattered and which did not? Well, to start, let's look at the individual p-values for each
# variable we have. We'll do this by pulling out the p-values and coefficient names.
p_vals <- summary(model_lm1)$coefficients[,4]

# Now that we have the coefficients that matter, let's re-run the linear model only on the coefficients we see above

# We see from this model that our R-squared value dropped significantly. Very strange, and not what I expected.
# Let's try bringing in the two variables that were just above the .05 threshold (U@ and Po1).

# Great! Our R-squared value went up to 76.6% and our adjusted R-squared went up to 73.1%. In particular, we notice
# that our R-squared value has gone down (it was originally 80.3%); however, our adjusted R-squared value has gone up
# (it was originally 70.1%). This makes sense because adjusted R-squared factors in the number of variables, and

# Predict what the crime rate would now be
predict(model_lm3, new_data) 
# The linear regression model estimates that the Crime rate based on this data will be 35.79. This translates to
# about 36 crimes per 100,000 population. This seems extremely off from our original dataset, so we'll instead
# resort to our original, unscaled data which included every variable.


# Now let's take a look at the confidence interval for this new data
predict(model_lm3, new_data, interval = "confidence")
# The same linear regression model estimates 798 crimes per 100,000 population. It also estimates that
